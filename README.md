# DynamicProgramming
This is the repository for saving the assignments from the course Dyn. & Prog. which I took in 2020 spring. 

I set up this repository to share my ideas while handling with the problems I learned in class. My solutions were not perfect and not the most efficient. Any comments and suggestions are welcomed.

For those who just get started to learn the optimal control theory or Markov stochastic processes, the included examples may help a lot. But for those who would like to do some further research, these examples are not enough.

The assignments may not change a lot every year, so it might be a problem that this project would become “Accomplice” of the unearned. **Please do not use my version for your submission** if you are the student of the similar courses. I suggest you take this as a reference, and then write your own code. You will benefit a lot.
