# DynamicProgramming
This is the repository for saving the assignments from the course Dyn. & Prog. which I took in 2020 spring. 

I set up this repository to share my ideas while handling with the problems I learned in class. My solutions were not perfect and not the most efficient. Any comments and suggestions are welcomed.

For those who just get started to learn the optimal control theory or Markov stochastic processes, the included examples may help a lot. But for those who would like to do some further research, these examples are not enough.

Textbook I used and highly recommended is *Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control* authored by *Dimitri P. Bertsekas*. It includes not only theoretical analysis but also some application techniques which are introduced by real examples.
