    "#### Problem 1\n",
    ">A machine may be in two states:  good or bad.  It produces an item at the end of each time period.  If the machine is bad, the item is bad/defective as well.  If the machine is good, then the  item  is  good.   A  machine,  which  is  good  at  stage $t$ may  become  bad  at  stage $t+ 1$  with probability $p$.  A bad machine remains bad,  unless replaced.  The state of the machine is not visible and can be identified only by inspecting the produced items.  An item produced in period $t$ may be inspected immediately at cost $I$.  The inspection is perfect,  that is,  it distinguishes between good and defective items without mistakes.  If the inspection finds the item bad, the machine may be replaced at a cost $R$.  The cost of producing a bad item is $C$."
